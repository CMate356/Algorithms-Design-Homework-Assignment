For the algorithm inside "Algorithms Design Homework Assignment" to compile both source files(main.c and codeeditor.c) and  the header file (codeeditor.h) need to be added to the same project.
Nothing needs to be done for "experimental_algorithm" (the project that was used to experiment with non-trivial data) because it only contains one source file(main.c).
